//Bugs: image shows up at wrong guess
//      wrong button press adds guesses


//check reset function
//Bugs:
    //stop logging 'enter'
    //(X) pressing the wrong button for a second time will not could as a guess
        //store ALL letters pressed in array
        //if letter pressed is in array already
            //then alert that letter has already been pressed
            //OR
            //nothing happens
        //else if letter pressed is incorrect AND not in the array
            //then add to array and subtract a guess
//Logic to write:

//wip
    //Hints:
        //(X)Types given after 5 wrong
        //(X) need to add logic to set src=""

        //image Sil after 10 wrong
